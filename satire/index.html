        <p>
          Sidney Stewart, a Terps football defensive lineman, was arrested on Tuesday night after a high-speed scooter chase through campus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stewart was riding through campus after spending the night at Looneys, a popular bar on Baltimore Avenue. UMPD Officer James Franklin noticed Stewart driving recklessly and at extreme speeds through McKeldin Mall at around 3:37 a.m. 
        </p>

        <p>
          After noticing the officer in pursuit, Stewart ditched the scooter and ran approximately 75 yards before being apprehended. Notably, it was the longest run by a Terps football player this season.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once stopped, Franklin noticed an intense odor of alcohol on Stewart’s breath, resulting in him conducting a field sobriety test and breathalyzing him. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Stewart failed the field sobriety tests and had a 0.2% blood alcohol level. Stewart is 19 years old, under the legal drinking age. Officer Franklin arrested him, and he is facing charges for DUI and underage drinking. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This arrest follows the trend of UMPD’s crackdown on scooter-related crimes: focusing on keeping the campus roads clear of dangerous riders, especially those without helmets or under the influence. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the beginning of this year, UMPD has arrested 705 students for scooter-related incidents, compared to just five for the much less serious crime of car theft. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Coincidentally, the 705 arrests also coincide with the number of days it has been since Maryland football appeared in a bowl game.
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked about the incident, coach Michael Locksley said that the best is no longer ahead for Stewart.
        </p>

        <!-- ADD A PULL QUOTE SPOT -->
        <p>
          “You know, we gotta take accountability for our actions. Plain and simple…we f***king sucked this year,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that word of the incident has gone public, Stewart has received a large NIL offer to transfer from the Georgia football program, according to his agent.
        </p>

        <p>
          “At the University of Georgia, we know a thing or two because we’ve seen a thing or two,” coach Kirby Smart said. “We’d welcome Sidney to our football program with open arms.”
        </p>

        <p>
          However, instead of being allowed to transfer, Stewart is facing the ultimate punishment from Locksley: playing the rest of his career for Maryland football.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Terps coach said he originally threatened Stewart with suspension, but when he was told that it was a welcome offer, he renegotiated with the office of student conduct for the more severe punishment.
        </p>

        <p>
          University of Maryland Police put out a statement about this punishment being adequate. “The UMD Police Department agrees that since our football team is so terrible, it is a fair punishment,” a spokesperson for the department said.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stewart said he was excited to see the flashing lights behind him because it would make his former athletic director proud.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I’m just tryna do what those before me set the stage for,” Stewart said.
        </p>

        <p>
          UMPD said that they are committed to keeping the campus safe and keeping reckless scooter drivers like Stewart off the streets.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We can’t afford to arrest reckless drivers in cars because then we won’t have anybody to give parking tickets to,” UMPD police chief David Mitchell said. “That’s why we’re so focused on keeping these felonious scooter riders off the streets.

            Editor’s Note: As of Dec. 4, Stewart has filed an appeal that is expected to reach the Supreme Court, stating it falls under the "cruel or unusual punishment" section of the Eight Amendment.
