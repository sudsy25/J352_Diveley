        <!-- STORY -->

        <p>On a typical weekday at the University of Maryland, electric scooters zoom across campus, zipping past students walking to class. What began as a convenient substitute for biking or walking has become a defining feature of campus mobility. Electric scooters are fast, efficient, and, increasingly, risky.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://umpd.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2024-12/AnnualSecurityReport.pdf" target="_blank">the university’s 2025 Annual Security Report</a>, motor vehicle thefts, which includes e-scooters, rose from 53 cases in 2022 to 141 cases in 2023. There was a major leap to 287 cases in 2024, with 261 of those cases being e-scooters. That's more than 90% of all reported motor vehicle thefts last year.</p>

        <p>Lt. Rosanne Hoaas, UMPD’s public information officer, said that the numbers reflect how e-scooters have integrated themselves into one of the most important aspects of transportation on campus. She explains how difficult it can be to protect them.</p>

          “There’s a lot going on when it comes to micromobility, especially when it comes to safety and security,” she said. “Our role [is] making sure people are following the rules of the road, what they can do as operators of micro mobility devices, and making sure they know those laws, but also how they can safeguard their property.”

        <h3 style="color:#203731; margin:30px 0px 10px 0px;">New policies regarding riding on campus</h3>

        <p>The surge in thefts occurs in a time of reformation of micromobility policy on campus. This fall, the university enforced an interim rule, requiring all students to wear helmets when riding. Students who are caught without a helmet can be reported to the Office of Student Conduct. This was a recommended measure created by a campus micromobility workgroup focused on improving rider safety.</p>

        <p>The helmet rule was a follow-up to a major announcement by <a href="https://transportation.umd.edu" target="_blank">the Department of Transportation Services</a> earlier this year: students living in on-campus residence halls, university-owned fraternity/sorority houses, and South Campus Commons can no longer bring electric scooters or electric bikes on campus.</p>

        <p>DOTS explained that multiple battery-related fires and limited charging infrastructure as reasons for the restriction. The department also issued a $35 annual fee for registering personal electric micromobility vehicles. They followed it up by declaring there would be an expanded number of Veo scooters beginning this fall.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#203731; margin:30px 0px 10px 0px;">Riding behavior and collisions remain as greatest concerns</h3>

        <p>Even though there have been tight regulations, riding the scooters is still very common. The risks of riding the scooters don’t change, no matter how many rules or regulations are put in place. Maryland Law treats e-scooters as motor vehicles, stating they must be driven in roadways, not on sidewalks.</p>

        <p>“So as such, you have to ride in the roadway,” said Lt. Hoaas. “When you're riding on the sidewalk, not only are you infringing upon the rights, if you will, pedestrians, because pedestrians belong on sidewalks, … you're then creating a potential situation where it becomes unsafe for all parties involved.”</p>

        <p>She noted that the department has seen collisions not only between e-scooters and pedestrians, but e-scooters vs. e-scooters and even between e-scooters vs. other vehicles. Officers do issue citations, she said, but education remains the priority for all students.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#203731; margin:30px 0px 10px 0px;">Students describe e-scooter experiences</h3>

        <p>Even students without e-scooters have seen how the new implications have affected their daily campus life.</p>

        <p>Brian Dwyer, a senior, said that the rise in e-scooter usage hasn’t seen many students wear helmets when riding their e-scooters.</p>

          “I don’t think I’ve seen many students wear helmets this semester,” he said. “I actually didn’t know about there being a rule for that until you mentioned it.”
        </div>

        <p>Another student, Jack Parmach, still has to worry about riders on the sidewalk every time he walks to class or the dining hall.</p>

          “I constantly feel the need to check around me when walking around,” he said. “I’m always listening to music, and sometimes people will zoom past me in all directions, and they get a little too close for comfort.”
        </div>

        <p>As e-scooters become a staple of everyday campus life, UMPD will continue to regulate and educate students on risks and safety precautions.</p>

        <p>“Our primary objective is education,” said Lt. Hoaas. “And then,  as needed, enforce as well, too.”</p>
